# Netlify Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Configuration Files**
   - ✅ `netlify.toml` configured with correct build settings
   - ✅ `_redirects` file added to `client/public/` for SPA routing
   - ✅ `.nvmrc` file added specifying Node.js 20

2. **Build Optimization**
   - ✅ Updated build command to use `npm ci` for faster, more reliable installs
   - ✅ Set Node.js version to 20 in netlify.toml
   - ✅ Added NPM_FLAGS for production build

3. **HTML Cleanup**
   - ✅ Removed Replit-specific scripts from index.html
   - ✅ Updated Open Graph meta tags with correct branding
   - ✅ Ensured proper meta descriptions for SEO
   - ✅ Added custom infinity logo favicon in multiple formats
   - ✅ Created web app manifest for PWA capabilities

4. **File Structure**
   - ✅ Build output directory: `dist/public`
   - ✅ Static files in `client/public/`
   - ✅ Favicon and assets properly referenced

## 🔧 Build Process

The build process includes:
1. Frontend build using Vite (React + TypeScript)
2. Backend build using esbuild (Node.js + Express)
3. Static file optimization and chunking

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration
3. Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist/public`
5. Node.js version: 20

## ⚠️ Known Considerations

- Build time may be longer due to large icon library (Lucide React)
- All Replit-specific configurations have been removed
- SPA routing handled via _redirects file
- Environment variables can be added in Netlify dashboard if needed
